# PyBer Analysis
# Overview of the Analysis
For this project, we conducted an analysis of Pyber ride sharing data to discover the total amount of drivers, riders, Total Fares, average fare per ride, and average fare per driver. We also analyzed the type of cities which Pyber operates in, inlcusing rural, suburban, and urban cities. We created visualizations of rideshare data for Pyber to improve their ride sharing servies and determine their affordability. 

# Results
I have provided a screenshot of the Pyber Ride sharing Data Summary:

- Urban cities have the highest demand for rides while rural cities have the lowest.
- Urban cities have over 40% more drivers than suburban cities.
- Suburban cities have over 6 times more drivers than rural cities with more than 4 times total fares.
- Rural cities have the highest average fare per ride and driver.
- Total fares was highest in urban cities which has the highest amount of drivers and rides. 

# Summary 
After analyzing this ride sharing data for Pyber, I have three recommendations for the CEO of Pyber. First, I would recommend to increase the amount of drivers in rural cities. This would help meet demand in rural cities, as there are 78 total drivers and 125 total rides. Second, I would do the same for Suburban cities, adding more drivers to meet demand as there are 490 total drivers and 625 total rides. Third, I would realocate the number of drivers in Urban cities to Suburban or rural cities as there are surplus of drivers in the Urban cities.
