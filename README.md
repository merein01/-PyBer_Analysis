# PyBer Analysis
# Overview of the Analysis
For this project, we conducted an analysis of Pyber ride sharing data to discover the total amount of drivers, riders, Total Fares, average fare per ride, and average fare per driver. We also analyzed the type of cities which Pyber operates in, inlcusing rural, suburban, and urban cities. We created visualizations of rideshare data for Pyber to improve their ride sharing servies and determine their affordability. 

# Results










# Summary 
After analyzing this ride sharing data for Pyber, I have three recommendations for the CEO of Pyber. First, I would recommend to increase the amount of drivers in rural cities. This would help meet demand in rural cities and ensure no shortage of drivers in these types of cities.
